# Contributing Guidelines

## Always Build on Your Own Branch

* Always branch new features off `main`! 
  * This helps keep all of the code up to date and helps with releases stable and up to date!
* Make your own branch!
  * Whether the branch is for a bug fix or a story, please be sure to not build on main!
  * Any pushes to main will be denied!
* Please use the [pull request template](.github/pull_request_template.md) to your advantage!
  * Always PR properly by using the PR template and filling it out as fully as possible!
  * Always request a review from a member of the [organization](https://github.com/orgs/terrabl/people), otherwise the request may be ignored.

* When contributing, remember that this is and open source project! Please do not forget to document your code so someone else can contribute updates or bug fixes. Failure to comment to a reasonible extent will result in denied PR's.
